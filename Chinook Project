# In this project, I analyzed the data from https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x to answer the following: ##


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT firstname, lastname, customer, country
FROM Customers 
WHERE Country != 'USA';


#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;


#3. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'


#4. How many Invoices were there in 2009? What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


#5. How many tracks fit into the 'Metal' category?

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.genres
WHERE Name = 'Metal' --> GenreId is '3' for metal

SELECT COUNT(GenreId)
FROM chinook.tracks
WHERE GenreId = '3'


#6. Which sales agent made the least amount of dollars in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  ASC LIMIT 1;


#7. Show only the customers from the US:

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "USA" ;


#8. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";


#9. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;
