In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, 
then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

/* Create table about the people and what they do here */

CREATE TABLE famous_people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER, profession TEXT, songs TEXT, awards TEXT);

INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (1, 'Jeon Jungkook', 26, 'Golden Idol', 'Still with you', 'yes');
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (2, 'Park Jimin', 28, 'Singer', 'Promise','yes');
INSERT INTO famous_people VALUES (3, 'SUGA', 30, 'Rapper/Singer','Set me free','yes');

CREATE TABLE vocal_abilities (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, lowest_key TEXT, highest_key TEXT, vocal_range TEXT);
INSERT INTO vocal_abilities VALUES (1, 'Jeon Jungkook', 'G2','B5', 'tenor');
INSERT INTO vocal_abilities VALUES (2, 'Park Jimin', 'A2', 'Bb5','tenor');
INSERT INTO vocal_abilities VALUES (3, 'SUGA' , 'Eb2', 'Bb5', 'baritone');

SELECT famous_people.name, vocal_abilities.lowest_key
FROM famous_people 
JOIN vocal_abilities
ON famous_people.name = vocal_abilities.name;

SELECT famous_people.name, vocal_abilities.highest_key

CREATE TABLE physical_image (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, blood_type TEXT, eye_color TEXT, height INTEGER);
